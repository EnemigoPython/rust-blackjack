# rust-blackjack
A Blackjack CLI game written in Rust, as a learning experience.

# instructions
If you already have Rust and Cargo, clone the repo and run `cargo run`.

# rules
[This](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/ "blackjack rules") link provides the rules of Blackjack used as a reference. Like with my [C# project](https://github.com/EnemigoPython/blackjack "link to C#"), I haven't bothered to implement logic for splitting a hand.
